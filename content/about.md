# About

## mux is a digital workshop for tools, toys, and tech experiments.

### Purpose

mux is where I build in the open â€” a playground for projects, tools, and ideas that help me think out loud and sharpen my craft.

Some of these projects are experiments. Others are growing into something biggerâ€¦ maybe ðŸ˜…. All of them are fueled by curiosity.

### Who am I?

I'm Michael J. Seiter â€” a web developer with a love for well-crafted interfaces and a growing appetite for backend systems.  

After years focused on the frontend, Iâ€™ve been digging deeper into the stack to understand how the pieces connect â€” and how to build better systems end to end.

I started mux to document the process of building dev tools, reflect on what Iâ€™m learning, and share what sticks.

### Current Projects

- **CyclUndo**  
  A TypeScript undo/redo package using a circular buffer.  
  `#typescript` `#data-structures`

- **Track Haus**  
  CLI-based music tracking for pianobar.  
  `#python` `#api` `#bash`

- **StackTime**  
  A code time-tracker (possibly) using ClickHouse.  
  `#cli` `#clickhouse` `#metrics`


### Trending (with me) Tools

TypeScript, Lit, Laravel, Python â€” and whatever helps me move fast and keep it fun.
