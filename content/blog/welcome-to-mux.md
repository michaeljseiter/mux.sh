mux is a digital workshop where I tinker, build, break things (intentionally), and write about it.

Right now, it’s just a modest site powered by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), but I’ll be using it to:
- Document what I’m building
- Reflect on what I’m learning
- Publish small updates, experiments, and dev logs

This is me building in the open. Imperfect, in-progress, and always fun.

## 🍔 What’s cooking?

Here’s what’s currently bouncing around in the lab:

- **CyclUndo**  
  A TypeScript undo/redo package using a circular buffer.  
  `#typescript` `#data-structures`

- **Track Haus**  
  CLI-based music tracking for pianobar.  
  `#python` `#api` `#bash`

- **StackTime**  
  A code time-tracker (possibly) using ClickHouse.  
  `#cli` `#clickhouse` `#metrics`

## 🤔 Why “mux”?

It's short for *multiplexing*, which means sending multiple signals over a single channel.

That’s basically what this site is: a single place to broadcast my scattered side projects, thoughts, and tool-building obsessions.

## 🔮 What to expect

- Quick project updates
- Deep dives (when I have the energy)
- Honest, personal notes about learning and building

If you like dev tools, data, weird CLI stuff, or watching someone nerd out in public, you might enjoy hanging around.

Thanks for stopping by.
